# Build an SAP Fiori App Using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model [RAP100]
Develop a UI service for an SAP Fiori elements-based application with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). In this mission, an ADT wizard is used to speed up the generation of all needed ABAP artefacts based on a database table. The managed implementation along with the internal unmanaged numbering is used. The transactional behavior of the RAP business object is implemented using determinations, validations, and different types of actions. This developer tutorial mission can be carried out on an SAP BTP, ABAP environment, an SAP S/4HANA Cloud, ABAP environment, or an SAP S/4HANA (release 2022 or higher) system.
